# SvelteKit Markdown Starter

Bare SvelteKit project with markdown support via [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/). Use this as a starter, or check out the second commit to see how easy it is to set up from a fresh SvelteKit app!

[Live Demo!](https://svelte-markdown-demo.pages.dev/)

`/src/routes/+page.svelte` demonstrates importing markdown content as a component, and `/src/routes/pure-markdown/+page.md` demos creating pages directly from markdown!
